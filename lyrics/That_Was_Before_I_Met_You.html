 That Was Before I Met You

 I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
 I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
 I thought I was swinging the world by its tail I thought I could never be blue
 I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you

 I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
 I never saw one that would ever hold me but that was before I met you
 I thought I was swinging the world by its tail I thought I could never be blue
 I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you

 They say every man must reap what he sows but darling I hope that's not true
 For once I had plans for living alone but that was before I met you
 I thought I was swinging the world by its tail I thought I could never be blue
 I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you
