 I went up on a mountain
 Give my horn a blow
 Thought I heard my true love saying
 Yonder comes by beau
<i>
 Rove Riley Rove
 Rove Riley Rove
 Rove Riley poor boy
 Got nowhere to go
</i>
 I went up on the mountain
 Done stripped me a load of cane
 I'll make me a bag of molasses
 For Sweet Miss Liza Jane

 My daddy had a great big house
 A hundred stories high
 And every story in that house
 Was filled with chicken pie

 My mama gave me one drink
 My daddy gave two
 I want another one so bad
 I didn't know what to do

 Lil possum is a pretty thing
 She rambles in tha dark
 The only time you know she's round
 You hear her Redwood bark

 I wish my heart was made of glass
 In which you might behold
 Where her name is written there
 In letters of pure gold

 Mama give me meat
 Mother give me bread
 Pretty girl give me one sweet kiss
 Like to done killed me dead

 No never marry an old man
 I'll tell you the reason why
 His lips are all tobbaccy juice
 And he never zips his fly

 Never marry a doctor
 I'll tell you the reason why
 He rides all over the country
 And makes the people die

 Don't never marry a lawyer
 I'll tell you the reason why
 Every time he opens his mouth
 He tells a great big lie
