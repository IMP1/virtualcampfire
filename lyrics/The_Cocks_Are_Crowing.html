The Cocks Are Crowing

The cocks are crowing, daylight is appearing
It's drawing nigh to the break of day
"Arise, my darling, out of your slumber
Arise, my darling and come awake."

And when he came to her true love's window
He kneeled down low upon a stone
And through the window he whispered softly
"Arise, my darling, and let me in"

"Well who is that who is at my window?
And who is that that gives me no rest?"
"'Tis I, 'tis I, a poor wounded lover
Who fain would speak with you, love, a while."

"Well go away then, and ask your daddy
If he would have you my bride to be
And if hе says no then return and tell mе
For this is the last time I will trouble thee"

"Oh my dada is in his bed chamber
He's fast asleep on his bed of ease
And in his pocket, there lies a letter
Which reads 'Much darling, unto your disgrace."

"Oh what disgrace can he do unto me?
A faithful husband to you I'll be
And what other neighbors have 'round their houses
The same, my darling, you will have with me."

"Oh go away then, and ask your mummy
If she would have you my bride to be
And if shе says no, then return and tell mе
For this is the last time I will trouble thee"

"Oh my mama she is an old age woman
And she can hear not one word I say
She would bid you go love and court some other
For I am not a fitting love your bride to be"

Oh I will go unto the wild mountains
Where I will see nothing but the wild deer
And I'll eat nothing but the wild herbs and
I'll drink nothing but my true loves tears

If the ghilly boy line in the chorus
And the green fields they were main and wide
If my pen were made of the tempered steel sure
My true loves praises I would never write.
