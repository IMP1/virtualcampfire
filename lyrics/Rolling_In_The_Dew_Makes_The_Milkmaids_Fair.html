“Oh where are you going to, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“I’m going a-milking, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What if I should follow you, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“Well surely you can please yourself, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What if I should lie you down, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“Why surely I’d get up again, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What I should dirt your gown, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“Why surely it would wash again, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What if you should have a child, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“Why surely you would father it, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What should we do for a cradle, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
Oh what should we do for a cradle, my dear?”
“My father is a basket maker, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“Then what should we do for linen, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
Oh what should we do for linen, my dear?”
“My father he's a linen-maker, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”

“What if I should run away, my pretty fair maid
With your red, rosy cheeks and your curly black hair?”
“May the devil fetch you back again, kind sir,” she answered me,
“Rolling in the dew makes a milkmaid fair.”
