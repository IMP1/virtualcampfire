 <i>
I've got a pig, home in a pen
Corn to feed him on
All I need is a pretty little girl
To feed him when I'm gone
 </i>
Goin’ on the mountain to sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of Sorghum sweet little Liza Jane.

Black cloud’s a-risin’ surest sign of rain
Put the old grey bonnet on little Liza Jane.

Yonder comes that gal of mine how you think I know?
Can tell by that Gingham gown hangin’ down so low.

Bake them biscuits baby, bake them good and brown
When you've got them biscuits baked we're Alabama bound
