 Don't you wanna go to heaven Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
 Don't you wanna go to heaven Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
 Don't you wanna go to heaven Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe
 Don't mind the weather so the wind don't blow

 Yes I want to go to heaven just the same as any man
 Yes I want to go to heaven just the same as any man
 Yes I want to go to heaven just the same as any man
 But I can't go to heaven with a possum in my hand

 Hop on my ladies, three in a row
 Hop on my ladies, three in a row
 Hop on my ladies, three in a row
 Don't mind the weather so the wind don't blow
