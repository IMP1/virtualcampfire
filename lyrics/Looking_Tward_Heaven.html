The angel does  call us
To gaze towards heaven
When Jesus was going away
They say he is coming
He is coming coming in glory some day

And now we are looking and watching and waiting
To hear the glad words he will say
Some wonderful morning, on clouds of great glory
He is coming he is coming some day

No wonder the angel spoke to the disciples their hearts were so filled with dismay
What comfort it gave them what pleasant assurance
He is coming in glory some day
He is coming in glory one day

And now we are looking and watching and waiting
To hear the glad words he will say
Some wonderful morning, on clouds of great glory
He is coming, he is coming some day

This promise to precious
Both cleaner and sweeter
To all who will trust and obey
Today and tomorrow and let us be merry
He is coming in glory some day

And now we are looking and watching and waiting
To hear the glad words he will say
Some wonderful morning, on clouds of great glory
He is coming, he is coming some day
