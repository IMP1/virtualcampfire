Hush-a-bye, don't you cry, go to sleep my little baby
When you wake you shall have your cake driving those pretty little horses
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, coach and six little horses

Rockabye, don't you cry, go to sleep my little baby
Send you to school riding on a mule driving those pretty little horses
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, coach and six little horses

Lullabye, don't you cry, go to sleep my little baby
Down ride, riding through the night driving those pretty little horses
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys, coach and six little horses

Way down yonder, in the meadow
Lies a poor little lambie
And a Bee and a fly plucking at his eye
Poor little baby cries mammy
