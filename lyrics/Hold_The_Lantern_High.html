<i>
Hold the lantern high, lad
Hold the lantern high
Catch your daddy's eye, laddie
Catch your daddy's eye
</i>

Cullercoat's sands are cold and bare
Many there must weep
Say your prayer for those who share
The grief that they keep

Its none but us to rue his loss
If he should not come home
Safe in bed do not fuss
It's all the same to them

Do not fear for you will hear
The shouts across the bay
Whether far or near, you will not fear
Your lantern lights the way

Safe on shore he's home once more
The sea he'll soon return
Whether far or near, you will not fear
As long as lanterns burn
