 Whisky Johnny

<pre>
Whiskey is the life of man
Whiskey from an old tin can

I like whiskey hot and strong
And I’ll drink whiskey all day long
<i>
 Whiskey-o, Johnny-o
 Rise him up from down below 𝄇
 Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o
 Up aloft this yard must go
 Come rise him up from down below
</i>
I’ll drink it hot, I’ll drink it cold
I’ll drink it new, I’ll drink it old

Some like whiskey, some like beer
I wish I had a barrel here

Whiskey killed my sister Sue
And whiskey killed by brother too

Whiskey killed my poor old dad
And whiskey drove my mother mad

If whiskey comes too near my nose
It’s up she comes and down she goes

A glass of grog for every man
And a bottle full for the shanty man
