Mathilda, that's the name
Every seaman's playing her game
I wish none to see what she has done to me
And so my head's hanging in shame

You always said communicate
My silence made you irate
Now you will not listen
And like a piston
My heart's beating as you escape
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
Like feathers and flowers and snow
Our love has an ending I know
Our love may turn rotten
But won't be forgotten
And to the waves I must go
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
I want you, I need you
Can you tell me that you don't need me too
But you look in my eye
And sighing you tell me goodbye
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
My life line is broken in two
All of me belongs to you
North south east west
It's me in your breast
But to me you will not stay true
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
The waves they crash over the sand
Stroking the shore like a hand
Soothing the shingles
Please pacify those lonely and sad that pass by
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda why won't you wait for me
