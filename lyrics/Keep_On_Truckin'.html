<h1>
 Keep On Truckin'

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Drink your whiskey, drink your rye
Turn your thoughts up to the sky
Things will happen by and by
If you keep on trucking along
<i>
 Truckin', truckin', truckin',
 Truckin', truckin', truckin',
 Truckin', truckin', truckin',
 Keep truckin',
 Keep on truckin'
</i>
Drink your whiskey, drink your wine
Everything's going to turnout fine
You do your thing I'll do mine
And we'll keep on trucking along

Drink your whiskey, drink your booze
Some you win and some you lose
I got them old hill walking blues
So you keep on trucking along
