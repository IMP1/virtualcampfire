<pre>
He’s stone cold dead in the marketplace
He’s stone cold dead in the marketplace
He’s stone cold dead in the marketplace

But I kill nobody but me husband
Last night he went out drinking
Came home and gave me a beating
So I took up the rolling pin
And went to work on his head 'til I bashed it in

I lick him with the pot and the frying pan
I lick him with the pot and the frying pan
I lick him with the pot and the frying pan
But I kill nobody but me husband

His family they trying to kill me
His family they trying to kill me
His family they trying to kill me
But if I kill him he had it coming

There’s one thing that I’m sure
He ain’t going to beat me no more
So I tell you that I doesn’t care
If I was to die in the electric chair
