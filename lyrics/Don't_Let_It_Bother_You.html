Don't let it bother you
When things go wrong.
If you're glum, just hum this song,
Good luck will come along!

Don't let it bother you
If, now and then,
You may stumble,
Never grumble,
Count from one to ten!

A frown is a smile upside down,
Turn that frown upside down!
Then smile! Sing!
La-de-da-de-da-de-da, sing sing sing!

Don't let it bother you
When skies are grey.
Learn to grin,
Take it on the chin,
Everything will be okay!

A frown is a smile upside down,
Turn that frown upside down!
Then smile! Sing!
La-de-da-de-da-de-da, sing sing sing!

Don't let it bother you
When things go wrong.
If you're glum, just hum this song,
Good luck will come along!

Don't let it bother you
If, now and then,
You may stumble,
Never grumble,
Count from one to ten!

A frown is a smile upside down,
Turn that frown upside down!
Smile! Sing!
La-le-la-le-la-le-la, sing sing sing!
Don't let it bother you
When skies are grey.
Learn to grin,
Take it on the chin,
Everything will be okay
