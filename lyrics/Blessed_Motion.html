 Blessed Motion

I believed in solid ground
until I saw the earth in motion,
in the winds of steady change
and in the ever-rolling ocean

All moves on in perfect, perfect motion
All is change and ever-rolling ocean

All is moving, all is change,
though I once believed that there
might somehow be something firm beneath my feet, but
All is motion, and all is well for solid ground is just a myth
for those who never swim in it.
All is moving in blessed change, o the world we know
will come and go and everything will rearrange, so
be the ground beneath that sky,
tumbling round the by and by.
All is change, so am I. Lye lye lye, lye lye lye.
