Well, it's a jungle out there
The year 2018, I didn't think
We'd still be sorting babies into blue and pink
And all our progress
Well, I wonder what it means
That the only girls' clothes that work for me
Turn out to be boyfriend jeans

Well, that's fine
'Cause I decline
A narrow set of rules that just don't work
'Cause these red lines
Well, they're not mine
And if you need me, you can find me ironing my shirt

'Cause I'm in black tie tonight
Get a postcard to my
Year 11 self in a year 11 hell
Saying everything's gonna be alright
No, you won't grow out of it
You will find the clothes that fit

And the images that fucked ya
Were a patriarchal structure
And you never will surrender
To a narrow view of gender
And I swear there'll come a day (ah-ah)
When you won't worry what they say (ah-ah)
On the labels, on the doors
You will figure out what's yours

And it's a bloody nightmare
Tryna fight the spread of bigotry and fear
That's uniting Piers Morgan and Germaine Greer
And all our progress
Yeah, I wonder who it's for
When I dared to utter that trans lives matter, yeah
And all I got was a TERF war

Well, that's fine
'Cause I decline
Your narrow set of rules, they just don't work
These red lines
Well, they're not mine
And if you need me, you can find me ironing my shirt

'Cause I'm in black tie tonight
Get a postcard to my
Year 11 self in a year 11 hell
Saying everything's gonna be alright
No, you won't grow out of it
You will find the clothes that fit

And the images that fucked ya
Were a patriarchal structure
And you never will surrender
To a narrow view of gender
And I swear there'll come a day (ah-ah)
When you won't worry what they say (ah-ah)
On the labels, on the doors
You will figure out what's yours
You will figure out what's yours

And that it's got
Nothing to do with fitting neatly in a box
That was constructed to make it seem
Like people come in just two teams
And anything that's in between ain't good enough
And you will love
And you'll be loved

And you're in black tie tonight
Get a postcard to my
Year 11 self in a year 11 hell
Darling, everything's gonna be alright
No, you won't grow out of it
You will find the clothes that fit

And the images that fucked ya
Were a patriarchal structure
No, you never will surrender
To that narrow view of gender
And there's folks you've yet to meet (ah-ah)
But you're exactly up their street (ah-ah)
And they've been waiting just as long
To hear someone sing this song

And better days are on their way (ah-ah)
When it won't matter what they say (ah-ah)
On the labels, on the doors
You will figure out what's yours

And girl, you're gonna be so happy
And girl, you're gonna be just fine
And girl, you're gonna be so happy
Down the line, down the line
