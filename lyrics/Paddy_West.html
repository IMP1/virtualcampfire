As I was walking down London Road, I came to Paddy West house
He gave me a dish of American hash
And he called it Liverpool scouse
He said, "There's a ship, that's wanting hands and on her, you'll quickly sign
The mate's is a tyrant, the bosun's worse but she will suit you fine"

Put on you dungaree jacket and walk out looking your best
Don't tell them that your a poor sailor lad that came from Paddy West

Now when we’d had a feed, my boys, the wind began to blow;
He sent me up in the attic, the main-royal for to stow.
But when I got up in the attic, no main-royal could I find,
So I turned around to the window and I furled the window blind.

Put on you dungaree jacket and walk out looking your best
Don't tell them that your a poor sailor lad that came from Paddy West

Now Paddy yells out all hands on deck, their stations for to man.
His wife she stood in the doorway with a bucket in her hand;
And Paddy yells out, “Now let ’er rip!” and she flung the water our way,
Sayin’, “Clew up your fore t’gan’sl, boys, she’s takin’ on the spray!”

Put on you dungaree jacket and walk out looking your best
Don't tell them that your a poor sailor lad that came from Paddy West

There's one more thing for you to do before you sail away
Just step around the table where the bullock's head on display
And if they ask, 'Were you ever at sea?', you say, 'Ten times 'round the horn'
You can tell them you were a sailor since the day that you were born

Put on you dungaree jacket and walk out looking your best
Don't tell them that your a poor sailor lad that came from Paddy West
