Oh The smartest packet you can find
 <i>Ah Hee! Ah Ho! Are you most done</i>
Is the old Wildcat of the Swallowtail Line
 <i>So clear away the track and let the bulgine run</i>
 <i>
 With a Hey Rig-a-jig, in a jaunting car
 Ah Hee! Ah Ho! Are you most done
 With Eliza Lee all on my knee
 Oh, clear away the track and let the bulgine run
 </i>
Now the old Wildcat of the Swallowtail Line
She’s never a day behind her time.

We’re outward bound for New York Town
Them Bowery gals we’ll waltz around.

And when we dock at the South Street Pier
We’ll all go ashore and have some beer.

When we get back to Liverpool town
I’ll stand you whiskies all around.

When I get home across the sea
Eliza will you marry me?
