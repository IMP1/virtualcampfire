Thrashing Machine

<pre>
There was an old farmer in town he did dwell,
He'd one pretty servant, her name it was Nell.
He'd one pretty servant she was scarce seventeen
And he showed her the works of his thrashing machine.

Said Nell to the farmer "Its a fine summer's day
While the rest of the farmers are off making hay
Come into the barn where we won't be seen
And the two of us start working our thrashing machine.”

Oh Nell she stepped forward and into the barn
The horse got the harness and strapped it right on
Nell took the handle turned on the steam
And the two of them start working their thrashing machine

Oh six months being over and nine coming on
Her skirt wouldn't meet nor her drawers wouldn't draw
Its Then Nellie’s belly a story could tell.
Its under her apron like a young fairy queen
I'll have you transported for your thrashing machine.

Oh up comes the Judge with a pen in his claw,
He says lovely Nell you have broken the law.
There’s no turning today for the fields are so green,
For such is the strength of his thrashing machine.
