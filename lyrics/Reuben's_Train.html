Reuben's Train

<pre>
Well, Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
Sent it running to the Lord knows where
Oh me
Oh my
Run it to the Lord knows where

He rode it clean up town
When old Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
If this train runs me right, I’ll see my woman tomorrow night
Lord I'm nine hundred miles from my home

If my woman said so
I can't railroad no more
Lord I'll short track my engine and come on home
If this train runs me right, I’ll see my woman tomorrow night
Lord I'm nine hundred miles from my home
Yes I'm nine hundred miles from my wife and child
And I wish I was nine hundred more

The first day of the year when Reuben came up here
And he never has been seen since that day
Well they found his head in the driving wheel
A mile and half from town

Well I’ve been to the East, I’ve been to the West
I’m going where the chilly winds don’t blow
Oh Me,
Oh My
I’m going where these chilly winds don’t blow

Well, Reuben made a train and he put it on a track
Sent it running to the Lord knows where
Oh me
Oh my
Run it to the Lord knows where
