Farewell to Old England forever
Farewell to me old pals as well
Farewell to the well known Old Bailey
Where I once used to look such a swell
 <i>
  Singing toora-li, oora-li, additty
  Singing toora-li, oora-li, ay
  Singing toora-li, oora-li, additty
  For we’re bound for the Botany Bay
 </i>
There’s the captain as is our commander
There’s the bo’sun and all the ship’s crew
There’re the first and the second class passengers
Knows what we poor convicts go through

‘Taint the leaving Old England we cares about
‘Taint because we misspells wot we knows
But because all we light fingered gentry
Hops around with a log on our toes

Oh! had I the wings of a turtle dove
I’d soar on my pinions so high
Slap bang to the arms of my Polly love
And in her sweet presence I’d die

Now all my young dookies and duchessess
Take warning from what I’ve to say
Mind all is your own as you touchessess
Or you’ll find us in Botany Bay
