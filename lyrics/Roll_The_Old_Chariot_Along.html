Well, a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
And a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
And a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm
And we'll all hang on behind

We'll roll the old chariot along
We'll roll the old chariot along
We'll roll the old chariot along
And we'll all hang on behind

Oh a plate of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a plate of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a plate of Irish stew wouldn't do us any harm
And we'll all hang on behind

Oh a nice fat cook wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a nice fat cook wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a nice fat cook wouldn't do us any harm
And we'll all hang on behind

Oh a nice spell in jail wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a nice spell in jail wouldn't do us any harm
Oh a nice spell in jail wouldn't do us any harm
And we'll all hang on behind
