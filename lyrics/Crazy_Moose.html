There was a crazy moose (there was a crazy moose)
Who liked to drink a lot of juice (who liked to drink a lot of juice)

Singing way-oh, way oh (singing way-oh, way-oh)
Way-oh, way-oh, way-oh way-oh (way-oh, way-oh, way-oh, way-oh)
Way oh, way oh (way oh, way oh)

The moose's name was Fred.
He liked to drink his juice in bed.

He drank his juice with ease,
Until he spilled some on his knees.

He drank his juice with care,
Until he spilled some on his hair.

He drank his juice with class,
Until he spilled some on his ass.

Now he's a sticky moose.
A moose covered in juice.

All his hair went stiff.
So he combed it in a quiff.

His friends began to laugh.
So he had to take a bath.
