For if I was king, sure I'd make you my queen
I would roll you in my arms where the meadows they are green
Yes I'd roll you in my heart's content as I have you down to rest
Along side my Irish Colleen in the Magpie's Nest

For the Magpie's Nest is a cottage neat and clean
It stands alongside the Shannon where the meadows they are green
But of all the Irish colleens with such beauty blessed
Its the little Irish fairies in the Magpie's Nest

<i>
In the magpie's nest
In the magpie's nest
In the magpie's nest
</i>

For I've wandered all through Kerry, I've wandered all through Clare
From Dublin down to Galway, and from then to God knows where
But of all the Irish colleens with such beauty blessed
Its the little Irish fairies in the Magpie's Nest
