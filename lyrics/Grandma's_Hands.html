Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played the tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass"
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands soothed the local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her,
She'd say "Baby, Grandma understands
That you really Loved that man, put yourself in Jesus hands"
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands


Used to hand me a piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Pick me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, Mary don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core
But I don't have Grandma anymore
When I get to Heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
