 Poor Old

<pre>
I say old man your horse is dead
<i> And we say so! And we hope so</i>
I say old man your horse is dead
<i> Oh, poor old man!</i>

For a month of rotten life we’ve led
While you lay on your feather bed

But now that month is up, old Turk
Get up, you swine, and look for work

Get up, you swine, and look for graft
As we lays on, and yanks you aft

And yanks you aft and Devon law
And I hopes we'll never see you more
