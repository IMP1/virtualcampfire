 Few Days

<pre>
Well I pitched my tent on this campground
Few days, few days
And I give old Satan another round
And I am going home

I can't stay in these diggings
Few days, few days
Lord I can't stay in these diggings
And I am going home

Although I like the diggings here
I won't stay here another year

For years I've labored in cold ground
And now, at last, I'm homeward bound

I'm going home to stay a while
Before I go I'll plant a smile

These banking thieves I will not trust
But with me take my little dust

My mother she has gone before
I'll meet her there at glory’s door

So I pitched my tent on this campground
And I give old Satan another round
