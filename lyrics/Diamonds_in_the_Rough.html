 Diamonds in the Rough
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
While walking out one evening not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away before we held our show
I heard a band, a mission band singing with all its might
I give my heart to Jesus and left the show that night
 <i>
 The day will soon be over and digging will be done
 And no more gems be gathered so let us all press on
 When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
 The diamonds will be shining no longer in the rough
  </i>
One day my precious comrade was all too lost in sin
Another soul to rescue, when Jesus took him in
So when you’re tired and tempted, exhausted and rebuffed
Don’t turn away in anger those diamonds in the rough

While reading through the Bible, some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James, and John, on the Sea of Galilee
And Jesus when he found them, he bound them very tough
And they were precious diamonds, he gathered in the rough
