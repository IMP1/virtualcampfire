 Cakewalk Blues

I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
But now I'm feeling so much better, I could cakewalk into town

Ah well I woke up this morning feeling so good, you know I laid back down again
Throw your big leg up on me mama, I might not feel this good again

I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
But now I'm feeling so much better, I could cakewalk into town

Oh my baby, oh my baby, I just love the way she walks
And when my girl gets sleepy, man I love the way she baby-talks

I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
But now I'm feeling so much better, I could cakewalk into town

I want to go out on a picnic in the country and stay all day
I don't care if don't do nothing but while my time away

I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
But now I'm feeling so much better I could cakewalk into town

Now money that done get scarce, honey, work it done get hard,
I could spend my whole day stealing chickens, honey, from the rich folks yard

I had the blues so bad one time it put my face in a permanent frown
But now I'm feeling so much better, I could cakewalk into town
