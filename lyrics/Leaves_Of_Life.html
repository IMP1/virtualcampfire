 Leaves of Life

<pre>
All under the leaves and the leaves of life
I met with virgins seven.
And one of them was Mary mild,
Our Lord’s first mother in Heaven.

“Oh what are you seeking you seven pretty maids
All under the leaves of life?”
“We are seeking for no leaves, Thomas,
But for a friend of thine.”

“Go down, go down into yonder town
And sit in the gallery,
And there you’ll see sweet Jesus Christ,
Nailed to a big yew tree.”

So they went down into yonder town
Just as fast as foot could fall.
And many a bitter and grievous tear
From the virgins’ eyes did fall.

“Oh peace mother, oh peace mother
Your weeping does me grieve.
But I will suffer this,” he said,
"For Adam and for Eve.”

“Oh how can I my weeping leave
My sorrows undergo?
While I must see my own son die
And sons I have no more.”

He’s laid his head on her right shoulder
And death has struck him nigh.
“The Holy Ghost be with your soul
Sweet mother now I die.”

Oh the rose the gentle rose
The fennel it grows so strong.
Amen, sweet Lord, your charity
Is the ending of my song.
