Bring out the skillet, slip on the lid,
Mama's gonna make a little shortnin' bread.
That ain't all she's gonna do,
Mama's gonna make a little coffee, too.
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.
</i>
Three little children, lying in bed
Two were sick and the other were dead
Sent for the doctor and the doctor said,
"Feed those children on shortnin' bread."
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.
</i>
Store the skillet, store the lid,
Store people gonna make shortnin' bread;
Three dollars for the skillet, three dollars for the lid,
Three months in jail eating shortnin' bread.
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.
