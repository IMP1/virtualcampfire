As I walked by the dockside one evening so rare 
To view the still waters and take the salt air 
I heard an old fisherman singing this song 
Oh, take me away boys my time is not long 

Dress me up in my oilskins and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm taking a trip mates 
And I'll see them someday on Fiddler's Green 

Now Fiddler's Green is a place I've heard tell 
Where the fishermen go if they don't go to hell 
Where the weather is fair and the dolphins do play
And the cold coast of Greenland is far, far away 

Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm taking a trip mates 
And I'll see them someday on Fiddler's Green 

Where the skies always clear and there's never a gail 
And the fish jump on board with a swish of their tail 
Where you lie at your leisure, there's no work to do 
And the skipper's below making tea for the crew 

Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm taking a trip mates 
And I'll see them someday on Fiddler's Green 

And when you are in dock and the long trip is through
There's pubs and there's clubs and there's lasses there too
And the girls are all pretty and the beer is all free 
And there are bottles of rum hanging from every tree

Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm taking a trip mates 
And I'll see them someday on Fiddler's Green

Now I don't want a harp nor a halo, not me 
Just give me a breeze on a good rolling sea 
I'll play me old squeeze-box as we sail along 
With the wind in the riggin' to sing me a song 

Dress me up in me oilskins and jumper 
No more on the docks I'll be seen 
Just tell me old shipmates, I'm taking a trip mates 
And I'll see them someday on Fiddler's Green
