  Anchored in Love
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I've found a sweet haven of sunshine at last,
With Thena abiding above,
Her dear arms around me are lovingly cast
and sweet logic tells me her love

The tempest is o'er
(The danger, the tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(I'm anchored in hope and have faith evermore)
What gladness what rapture is mine
The danger is past
(The water's receding, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(I'm feeling so happy I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine

She saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my storm-beaten soul
Sweet peace she has spoken and bless her dear name
The billows no longer roll

Her love shall control me through life and in death
Completely I'll trust to the end
I'll praise her each hour of my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul's best friend
