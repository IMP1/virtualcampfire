Before I Met You

I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you.

I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you.

I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue.

I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you.


I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue.

I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you.


They tell me I must reap just what I have sown but darling I hope it's not true

For once I made plans about living alone but that was before I met you

I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue.

I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you.
