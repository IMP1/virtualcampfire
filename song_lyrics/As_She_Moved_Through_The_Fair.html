As She Moved Through the Fair
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">

My young love said to me
My mother won’t mind
And my father won’t slight you
For your lack of kind
As she stepped away from me 
And this she did say
"It will not be long love
‘Til our wedding day"

She stepped away from me
As she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Go here and go there
Then she went homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake.

The people were saying no two were ere wed
But one has a sorrow that never was said
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear 
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.

I dreamt it last night that my young love came in 
So softly she came
Her feet made no din
And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
"It will be long love
‘Til our wedding day".
