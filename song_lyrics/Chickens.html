Chickens
</h1>

<pre>
We had some chickens _ no eggs would they lay (x2) 
So I said honey, this sure ain't funny 
We're losing money; no eggs would they lay 
One day a rooster crept into our yard 
And caught those chickens right off of their guard 
They're laying eggs now just like they used to 
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had some moo-cows _ no milk would they give (x2) 
So, I said honey, this sure ain't funny 
We're losing money; no milk would they give 
One day a rooster crept into our yard 
And caught those moo-cows right off of their guard 
They're giving egg nog instead of milk now 
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had some elephants _ no tusks would they grow (x2) 
So I said honey, this sure ain't funny 
We're losing money; no tusks would they grow 
One day a rooster crept into our yard 
And caught those elephants right off of their guard 
They're laying eggs now of solid ivory 
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had a tractor _ it just wouldn't go (x2) 
So I said honey, this sure ain't funny 
We're losing money; it just wouldn't go 
One day a rooster crept into our yard 
And caught that tractor right off of its guard 
Now it goes EGGsactly just like it used to 
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.

We had some scientists _ they just wouldn't work (x2) 
So I said honey, this sure ain't funny 
We're losing money; they just wouldn't work 
One day a rooster crept into our yard 
And caught those scientists right off of their guard 
They're doing EGGsperiments just like they used to 
Ever since that rooster crept into our yard.
