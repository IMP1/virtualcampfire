Ally Bally, Ally Bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.

Mammy, gie's ma thriftie doon,
Here's auld Coulter comin roon
He's a basket on his croon
Sellin' Coulter's Candy. 

Ally Bally, Ally Bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.

Poor wee soul your getting affly thin,
A rickle o banes covered ower wi skin
Soon you'll have a wee double chin
Fra sookin Coulter's Candy.

Ally Bally, Ally Bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy. 

Willie wept baith lang and sair,
Till he got a penny tae share
Noo he’s tumblin doon the stair
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.

Ally Bally, Ally Bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.

Poor wee Annie was greetin tae,
What could poor auld Mammy dae?
But gie them a penny atween them twae
Tae buy mair Coulter's Candy.

Ally bally, ally bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.

Here comes Coulter doon the street,
The man the bairns aa like tae meet
His big black bag it hauds a treat
It’s full o Coulter's Candy.

Ally Bally, Ally Bally bee,
Sittin on yer mammy's knee
Greetin for a wee bawbee
Tae buy some Coulter's Candy.
