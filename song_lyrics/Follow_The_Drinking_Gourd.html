When the sun comes back
And the first quail calls
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
There the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

Follow the Drinking Gourd.
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
For the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

Now the riverbank makes a mighty fine road.
Dead trees will show you the way.
Left foot, peg foot, travelling on,
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

Follow the Drinking Gourd.
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
For the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

The river ends between two hills
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
There's another river on the other side
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

Follow the Drinking Gourd.
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
For the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the Drinking Gourd.

Where the little river meets the great big one 
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
There  the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the drinking gourd.

Follow the Drinking Gourd.
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
For the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom
Follow the Drinking Gourd.
