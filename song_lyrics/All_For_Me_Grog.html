Well it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me grog and tobacco
For I spent all me store with the lassies on the shore
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

When I get home then my sweetheart I shall see
All for me grog and tobacco
And me sweatheart'll sing when she sees the wedding ring
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

Well it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me grog and tobacco
For I spent all me store with the lassies on the shore
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

When she's a son for to danle on her knee
All for me grog and tobacco
And she'll sing him to sleep while I sail the stormy deep
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

Well it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me grog and tobacco
For I spent all me store with the lassies on the shore
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

When he's a man then a sailor he shall be
All for me grog and tobacco
With his pipe and his can like a proper sailor man 
And it's all for me grog and tobacco

Well it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
It's all for me grog and tobacco
For I spent all me store with the lassies on the shore
And it's all for me grog and tobacco
