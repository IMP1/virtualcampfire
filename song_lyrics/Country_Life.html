Country Life

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I like to rise when the sun she rises
Early in the morning
And I like to hear them small birds singing
Merrily upon their layland
And hurrah for the life of a country boy
And to ramble in the new-mown hay

In spring we sow, at the harvest mow
And that is how the seasons round they go
Oh but of all the times choose I may
'Twould be rambling in the new-mown hay

I like to rise when the sun she rises
Early in the morning
And I like to hear them small birds singing
Merrily upon their layland
And hurrah for the life of a country boy
And to ramble in the new-mown hay

In winter when the sky turns grey
We hedge and we ditch our lives away
But in the summer when the sun shines gay
We go rambling in the new-mown hay

I like to rise when the sun she rises
Early in the morning
And I like to hear them small birds singing
Merrily upon their layland
And hurrah for the life of a country boy
And to ramble in the new-mown hay
