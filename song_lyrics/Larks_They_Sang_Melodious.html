T'was pleasant and delightful one midsummer's morn 
To view the fine meadows all covered with corn 
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray 
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day 
And the larks they sang melodious 
And the larks they sang melodious 
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawning of the day.

A sailor and his true love were walking one day 
Said the sailor to his true love "I'm bound far away 
I'm bound for the East Indies where loud cannons roar 
I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl that I adore.
I must go and leave you Nancy
I must go and leave you Nancy
I must go and leave you Nancy you're the girl that I adore.

Then the ring from off her finger she instantly drew 
Saying "Take this dearest William and my heart will go too" 
And as she embraced him tears from her eyes fell 
Singing, "May I go along with you?" "Oh no my love farewell"
Singing, "May I go along with you?" 
Singing, "May I go along with you?" 
Singing, "May I go along with you?" "Oh no my love farewell"

Fare thee well to you my dearest Nancy, I can no longer stay, 
The ship is a-waiting out there in the bay. 
The anchor is hoisted, she waits the next flowing tide 
And if ever I return again I will make you my bride.
And if ever I return again
And if ever I return again
And if ever I return again I will make you my bride.
