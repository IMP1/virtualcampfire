Come all you young fellers so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune way down in the mine
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul
'Til the blood of your veins runs as black as the coal.
<i>
  For it's dark as a dungeon and dank as a tomb
  Where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few
  Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
  It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
</i>
It's many a man I have known in my day
Who lived just to labour his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope or a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine.
<i>
  For it's dark as a dungeon and dank as a tomb
  Where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few
  Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
  It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.
</i>
I hope when I die and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal.
As I look from the door of my heavenly home
I will pity the miner a slave to my bones.
